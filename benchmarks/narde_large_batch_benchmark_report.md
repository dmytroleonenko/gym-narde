## Conclusion

The PyTorch-accelerated environment with MPS shows significant performance improvements for operations with larger batch sizes:

- Board Rotation: 8.17x speedup at batch size 8192
- Board Operations: 84.00x speedup at batch size 8192

### Recommendations

Based on the benchmark results, for optimal performance on Apple Silicon:

1. Use MPS acceleration for batch operations with the following thresholds:

   - Board Rotation: Batch size ≥ 1024
   - Board Operations: Batch size ≥ 128

2. For operations with batch sizes below these thresholds, use CPU (NumPy or PyTorch CPU).

3. Implement dynamic device selection based on operation type and batch size.

### Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Custom CUDA Kernels:** For systems with NVIDIA GPUs, custom CUDA kernels could provide even greater acceleration.
2. **Operation Fusion:** Combining multiple operations to reduce memory transfers between CPU and MPS/GPU.
3. **Precision Reduction:** Using half-precision (float16) operations could further accelerate MPS performance.
