# Optimized Narde Environment

This optimized Narde environment selectively uses JAX acceleration for operations that benefit from it, while keeping NumPy for operations where JAX provides no advantage. The design decisions are based on comprehensive benchmarking of different operations at various batch sizes.

## Design Principles

1. **Selective Acceleration**: Use the right tool for each operation based on its characteristics and batch size.
2. **NumPy for Simple Operations**: Use NumPy for single-board operations and simple transformations.
3. **JAX for Complex Batch Operations**: Use JAX for complex operations with large batch sizes.
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Provide options to use either implementation based on the context.

## Implementation Details

The environment includes:

- **NumPy Implementation** for board rotation, single-board block rule checking, and general game logic.
- **JAX Implementation** for batched block rule checking and neural network operations.
- **Batch Size Threshold** to determine when to switch from NumPy to JAX (currently set at batch size 128).

## Performance Characteristics

Our benchmarks show the following performance characteristics:

### Board Rotation (Simple Operation)

NumPy consistently outperforms JAX for board rotation, even at large batch sizes:

| Batch Size | NumPy | JAX | Speedup |
|------------|-------|-----|---------|
| 1          | Faster | Slower | NumPy ~2x faster |
| 2048       | Faster | Slower | NumPy ~1.8x faster |

### Block Rule Checking (Complex Operation)

JAX outperforms NumPy for block rule checking at larger batch sizes:

| Batch Size | NumPy | JAX | Speedup |
|------------|-------|-----|---------|
| 1-128      | Faster | Slower | NumPy faster |
| 512        | Slower | Faster | JAX ~0.56x faster |
| 2048       | Slower | Faster | JAX ~1.74x faster |

The crossover point where JAX becomes faster than NumPy is around batch size 1024.

### Batch Simulation (Mixed Operation)

For batch simulation (which combines multiple operations):

| Batch Size | NumPy | JAX | Speedup |
|------------|-------|-----|---------|
| 32-512     | Faster | Slower | NumPy faster |
| 2048       | Slower | Faster | JAX ~1.50x faster |

The crossover point is around batch size 1024-2048.

## Usage in the MuZero Implementation

Based on these findings, the optimized environment is recommended to be used as follows in a MuZero implementation:

1. **For MCTS**: 
   - Use JAX for batch simulations when batch size â‰¥ 1024
   - Use NumPy for smaller batch sizes or individual simulations

2. **For Neural Networks**:
   - Use JAX for all neural network operations (representation, dynamics, prediction)
   - Apply hardware acceleration if available (GPU, TPU)

3. **For Game Logic**:
   - Use NumPy for individual game logic during actual gameplay
   - Use JAX for batched operations during training or massively parallel simulations

## Precision Considerations

When using JAX, consider the precision requirements:

- **FP32**: Standard precision, accurate but slower
- **BF16**: Lower precision, potentially faster on GPU/TPU, but less accurate
- Choose based on the specific hardware and accuracy requirements

## Future Optimizations

Potential future optimizations include:

1. Dynamic threshold adjustment based on hardware capabilities
2. Further vectorization of NumPy operations for smaller batch sizes
3. Hardware-specific optimizations for different accelerators (CUDA, Metal, TPU)

The environment is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different hardware configurations and performance requirements.
