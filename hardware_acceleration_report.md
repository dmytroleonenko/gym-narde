# Hardware Acceleration Report for MuZero on Mac with M-series Chips

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the performance benefits of hardware acceleration on Mac systems with M-series chips for MuZero implementations. We tested both PyTorch with Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) and JAX with its Metal backend, focusing on operations relevant to reinforcement learning and specifically MuZero.

**Key Findings:**
- PyTorch with MPS provides consistent acceleration for larger batch sizes and neural networks
- Best performance gains are seen with batch sizes of 2048-4096, with up to 1.97x speedup
- Matrix multiplication operations benefit most from MPS acceleration (up to 8.17x speedup)
- JAX with Metal currently has limited practical benefits due to operational constraints

**Recommendations:**
- Use PyTorch with MPS for MuZero training on Mac with batch sizes ≥ 512
- Focus on larger model architectures to maximize MPS benefits
- Consider hybrid approaches that use CPU for small batch operations and MPS for larger ones

## Benchmark Results

### PyTorch MPS vs CPU Performance

#### 1. Basic Operations

| Operation | Batch Size | CPU Time (s) | MPS Time (s) | Speedup |
|-----------|------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Matrix Mult | 2048 | 0.005100 | 0.000624 | 8.17x |
| Neural Network | 8192 | 0.012243 | 0.009692 | 1.26x |
| Vector Ops | 4096 | 0.001950 | 0.000734 | 2.66x |

Matrix multiplication shows the most significant acceleration, with speedups increasing as batch sizes grow. This is particularly relevant for MuZero's dense neural network components.

#### 2. MuZero Network Benchmark

| Batch Size | CPU Time (s) | MPS Time (s) | Speedup |
|------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | 0.000232 | 0.000850 | 0.27x |
| 8 | 0.000246 | 0.000844 | 0.29x |
| 32 | 0.000328 | 0.000846 | 0.39x |
| 128 | 0.000615 | 0.001007 | 0.61x |
| 512 | 0.001896 | 0.001594 | 1.19x |
| 1024 | 0.003655 | 0.002776 | 1.32x |
| 2048 | 0.007165 | 0.004982 | 1.44x |

For the MuZero network architecture, MPS acceleration becomes effective at batch sizes of 512 and above, with the speedup increasing with larger batches.

#### 3. Larger MuZero Network (512 hidden dim)

| Batch Size | CPU Time (s) | MPS Time (s) | Speedup |
|------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| 64 | 0.002096 | 0.001740 | 1.20x |
| 128 | 0.001890 | 0.002067 | 0.91x |
| 256 | 0.002473 | 0.002793 | 0.89x |
| 512 | 0.006349 | 0.004914 | 1.29x |
| 1024 | 0.009249 | 0.007832 | 1.18x |
| 2048 | 0.023408 | 0.013092 | 1.79x |
| 4096 | 0.040342 | 0.020464 | 1.97x |

With larger network sizes, MPS acceleration shows even more significant benefits at higher batch sizes, with nearly 2x speedup at batch size 4096.

### JAX with Metal Backend

Testing with JAX on Metal revealed several operational challenges:
- Limited support for certain operations required by MuZero
- Compatibility issues with the current implementation
- Runtime errors for traced boolean operations

While JAX with Metal shows promise for certain applications, PyTorch with MPS currently provides a more stable and effective approach for MuZero on Mac systems.

## Analysis and Recommendations

### Performance Patterns

1. **Batch Size Threshold**: For most operations, hardware acceleration becomes beneficial at batch sizes of 512 and above.

2. **Operation Complexity**: More complex operations with higher computational intensity benefit more from hardware acceleration.

3. **Memory Transfer Overhead**: For small batches, the overhead of transferring data between CPU and GPU memory negates the benefits of hardware acceleration.

### Implementation Recommendations

1. **Use PyTorch with MPS**: For MuZero implementation on Mac, PyTorch with MPS backend provides the most reliable performance gains.

2. **Batch Size Optimization**: Structure training to use batch sizes of 512 or larger when using MPS acceleration.

3. **Dynamic Device Selection**: Consider implementing logic to use CPU for small batches and MPS for larger batches to maximize performance across all operations.

4. **Model Architecture**: Larger neural networks (hidden dimensions ≥ 512) show better acceleration on MPS.

## Conclusion

Hardware acceleration via Metal Performance Shaders offers significant performance benefits for MuZero training on Mac systems with M-series chips, particularly for larger models and batch sizes. The gains are most pronounced for matrix multiplication and full network forward passes with batch sizes above 512.

For optimal performance, we recommend using PyTorch with MPS, focusing on larger batch sizes, and considering the specific operation characteristics when determining whether to use CPU or GPU execution.

The findings suggest that for production training of MuZero agents on Mac systems, hardware acceleration can reduce training time by up to 2x, making M-series Macs viable platforms for reinforcement learning research and development.
