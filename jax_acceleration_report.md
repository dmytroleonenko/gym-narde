2. Block rule checking (game rule validation)
3. Neural network forward pass (similar to MuZero)

## Key Findings

### 1. Simple Operations (Board Rotation) - Apple Silicon

For simple operations like board rotation (flipping a board and negating values):

| Batch Size | JAX (FP32) | NumPy | Speedup |

**Conclusion:** While JAX is slower than NumPy for small and medium batch sizes, we observe a crossover point at around batch size 4096, after which JAX becomes increasingly more efficient. At the largest batch size tested (16384), JAX is 2.4x faster than NumPy.

### 2. Complex Game Logic (Block Rule Checking) - Apple Silicon

For more complex game logic like checking the block rule (testing if all opponent pieces are in player's home):

| Batch Size | JAX | NumPy | Speedup |
|------------|-----|-------|---------|

| 4096       | 0.028419s | 1.664312s | 58.56x (faster) |
| 8192       | 0.028015s | 3.206242s | 114.45x (faster) |
| 16384      | 0.032951s | 6.397304s | 194.14x (faster) |

**Conclusion:** JAX shows dramatic speedup for complex operations as batch size increases. The crossover point where JAX becomes faster is around batch size 128. For very large batches (16384), JAX is almost 200x faster than NumPy, demonstrating exceptional scaling for vectorized operations.

| 4 | 0.028001 | 0.003005 | 0.11x (slower) |
| 16 | 0.029785 | 0.006752 | 0.23x (slower) |

| 4096 | 0.031723 | 0.916037 | 28.88x (faster) |

**Conclusion:** Similar to Apple Silicon results but with even higher maximum speedup, JAX with XLA on T4 GPU shows dramatic acceleration for matrix operations at larger batch sizes. The crossover point where JAX becomes faster is around batch size 256, with nearly 29x speedup at batch size 4096.

### 4. Neural Network Benchmark - NVIDIA T4 GPU

JAX with XLA on NVIDIA T4 GPU for neural network operations:

|------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| 1 | 0.002764 | 0.023579 | 8.53x (faster) |
| 4 | 0.550126 | 0.025947 | 0.05x (slower) |
| 16 | 0.489832 | 0.025228 | 0.05x (slower) |
| 64 | 0.506523 | 0.041642 | 0.08x (slower) |
| 256 | 0.728857 | 0.191426 | 0.26x (slower) |

**Conclusion:** For neural networks on T4 GPU, JAX demonstrated exceptional performance for single example inference (8.53x speedup) but struggled with larger batch sizes until the very largest (4096) where it was marginally faster than NumPy. This suggests that PyTorch with CUDA might be a better choice for neural network operations on T4 GPU.

## Precision Differences

When using BFloat16, we observed significant numerical differences compared to FP32:
- Mean absolute differences between FP32 and BF16 ranged from 0.4 to 0.8
- This level of difference could impact model convergence and quality
- Proper validation would be needed when using BF16 for the MuZero model

## Optimal Batch Size Thresholds

Based on our benchmarks, here are the recommended batch size thresholds for switching between NumPy and JAX:

| Operation | Platform | Recommended Threshold | Notes |
|-----------|----------|------------------------|-------|
| Board Rotation | Apple Silicon | 4096 | JAX becomes faster than NumPy around batch size 4096 |
| Block Rule Checking | Apple Silicon | 128 | JAX provides significant speedup beyond batch size 128 |
| Matrix Operations | T4 GPU | 256 | JAX with XLA provides exceptional speedup beyond this threshold |
| Neural Networks (CPU) | Apple Silicon | Small batches only | JAX is better for small batches, PyTorch better for large batches |
| Neural Networks (GPU) | T4 GPU | 4096 | JAX only shows small benefits at very large batch sizes |

## Recommendations

Based on the benchmark results, we recommend:

### For Apple Silicon:

1. **For board rotation and simple operations:**
   - Use NumPy for batch sizes < 4096
   - Use JAX for batch sizes ≥ 4096
   - The overhead of JAX compilation isn't worth it for simple operations unless using very large batch sizes

2. **For complex game logic operations:**
   - Use JAX with JIT compilation for batch sizes > 128
   - The vectorized implementation shows dramatic speedups for large batches (up to 194x)
   - For small batches (< 32), stick with NumPy

3. **For neural network operations:**
   - JAX provides significant speedup over PyTorch for small to medium batch sizes when running on CPU
   - If hardware acceleration (GPU/MPS) is available, prefer PyTorch for large batch sizes (>512)
   - On Apple Silicon, JAX FP32 is generally faster than JAX BF16 for CPU operations

### For NVIDIA T4 GPU:

1. **For matrix and tensor operations:**
   - Use JAX with XLA for batch sizes ≥ 256
   - Dramatic speedups (up to 28.88x) are possible for large batch sizes
   - Consider PyTorch with CUDA for smaller batch sizes

2. **For neural network operations:**
   - Use JAX with XLA for single example inference (8.53x speedup)
   - Use PyTorch with CUDA for batch inference, especially at medium batch sizes (16-1024)
   - Only use JAX for very large batches (≥ 4096) if memory constraints are a concern

### For MuZero implementation:

1. **On Apple Silicon:**
   - Use JAX for the neural network components for small batches and single-inference cases
   - Use JAX for batched game rule checking during MCTS (with batch sizes >128)
   - Continue using NumPy for individual board manipulations
   - Use PyTorch with MPS for large batch neural network operations (training)
   - BF16 precision may not be beneficial on CPU; test on GPU/TPU if available

2. **On NVIDIA T4 GPU:**
   - Use JAX with XLA for complex matrix operations and transformations
   - Use PyTorch with CUDA for neural network training and inference
   - Consider a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both frameworks
   - Implement dynamic batch size adaptation to maximize hardware utilization

## Future Work

Future benchmarking efforts should:
1. Test on other GPU hardware (A100, H100) where available
2. Evaluate the impact of mixed precision training on model convergence
3. Measure the end-to-end performance of the full MuZero implementation
4. Compare PyTorch with XLA compilation against JAX
5. Investigate memory usage patterns across different frameworks and hardware

## Conclusion

JAX provides significant acceleration for complex operations with large batch sizes, making it well-suited for certain components of the MuZero implementation. However, it's important to selectively apply JAX to the right components of the system, as it can actually slow down simple operations at small batch sizes. 

The ideal approach is a hybrid system that dynamically selects the right framework (JAX, NumPy, or PyTorch) based on the operation type, batch size, and available hardware. On NVIDIA T4 GPUs, JAX with XLA delivers excellent performance for matrix operations, while PyTorch with CUDA is generally better for neural networks.

For optimal performance across different hardware platforms, a flexible architecture that can leverage the strengths of each framework is recommended.
